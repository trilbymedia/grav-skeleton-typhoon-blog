The [Typhoon theme](https://getgrav.org/premium/typhoon) has powerful **page-level overrides** that let you customize the look of each page.  Child pages will then use any parent's settings as overrides before falling back to the **theme-level defaults**. This allows you to easily give your blog post some **bling**.

## Hero Options

Clicking on the **Hero** tab allows you to override any of the default theme-level Hero settings.  In this example you can see how **Subtitle** and **Title Text** as well as the **Hero Content** itself has been customized for this page.

## Hero Settings & Hero Overlay

You also have full control over the main **Hero Settings** which provide control such as alignment, a specific image to display and custom padding classes.

The **Hero Overlay** controls the overlay that sits **on top** of the image, but **below** the text.  This allows full control over the contrast between the image and text.
